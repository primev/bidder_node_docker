# MEV-Commit Bidder Docker Setup
This repository contains the Docker setup for running a MEV-Commit bidder node service in one container. The bidder node connects to the mev-commmit testnet and lets a user submit bids on the network.

# Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- A funded mev-commit address and valid private key - [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/) to receive funds.

# Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Prepare Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the repository and define the PRIVATE_KEY_BIDDER variable

3. Build and Run the Docker Containers
Run the following command to build the Docker image and start the bidder node service:

```bash 
docker-compose up --build
```

- Build the Docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04
- Install necessary dependencies (curl, jq, etc.)
- Download and install the latest mev-commit binary from the official repository

## Customization
Environment Variables
You can customize the following environment variables in the .env file or Docker Compose:

- PRIVATE_KEY_BIDDER: Your private key for authenticating the node with the testnet.
- DOMAIN: The MEV-Commit testnet domain, default is testnet.mev-commit.xyz.

## Running entrypoint directly
The entrypoint script can be run directly with `./entrypoint.sh` as a CLI script. It will prompt for a private key to use if one isn't provided as an `.env` variable.

# Networking with Other Repositories
To allow the mev-commit-bidder service to interact with other containers (like a l1 transaction sender bot) that are defined in different repositories, we use a Docker network. This network allows services to discover and communicate with each other via container names instead of hardcoded IP addresses.

## Creating the Network
Before running the containers, ensure that the shared network is created. This only needs to be done once:

```bash
docker network create app-network
```

The app-network allows the bidder node and other services (e.g., a bid sender) to communicate over the same network.

### Using the Network with Other Repositories
If you have other repositories with Docker services that need to communicate with this bidder node, make sure they also reference the same app-network. Here's an example of how to include this network in another repositoryâ€™s docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  bid-sender:
    networks:
      - app-network
    environment:
      - RPC_ENDPOINT=http://mev-commit-bidder:13524
networks:
  app-network:
    external: true
```
This ensures that the containers across different repositories can communicate with each other using container names, like mev-commit-bidder, for service discovery.


# Troubleshooting
Service not starting: Check the logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f mev-commit-bidder
```
